# Final Project - SDT and Diffusion Model Analysis

This project analyzes simulated response time data from a 2x2x2 experimental design (Trial Difficulty x Stimulus Type x Signal Presence) using Signal Detection Theory (SDT) and diffusion models!

The code includes functions for reading data, fitting a hierarchical SDT model, and generating delta plots.

The goal is to quantify the effects of Stimulus Type and Trial Difficulty on participant performance, compare model results, and interpret findings related to convergence and parameter estimates.
